# Audio Files

This directory should contain the following audio files for the V7 Cinematic Experience:

- `harvey.mp3` - Background music (Harvey by Hers)
- `pop.mp3` - Subtle pop sound for animals appearing
- `paper.mp3` - Paper rustle sound for letter opening
- `shimmer.mp3` - Magical shimmer sound for gallery fly-in or sparkles
- `whoosh.mp3` - Soft whoosh for scene transitions

Note: The code handles missing files gracefully, but for the full experience, please add these files.
